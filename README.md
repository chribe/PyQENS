PyQENS
======

PyQENS offers a framework to analyze neutron quasielastic scattering data. The idea is that the code is not specific for one instrument/ experiment but that it can be applied easily to several instruments and different type of measurements.
A detailed explanation is given in the manual (TODO: STILL HAS TO BE UPDATED)

Overview of folder contents:
----------------------------
* [old](old): contains files which were saved in the repository before the reorganization
* [Manual](Manual): Folder with LaTeX files for the Manual
* discussions: contains notes 
* [code](code): contains different folders with different versions of code:
  * [0.0.1](code/0.0.1/): First version of code which is able to perform fits on a q level.  Fits which take into account the q dependence are also implemented, but are not yet converging
